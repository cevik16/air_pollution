<div align="center"> <h1> POLLUTON MONITORING WITH SENTINEL-5P </h1> </div>
<div align="center"> <h2> Case Study: Paris 2019 vs. 2020 </h2> </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"> &ensp;&ensp; Governments and decisin-makers rely heavily on satellite data and computer models to show how pollution accumulates and how it is carried in the air so that they can develop appropriate mitigation strategies.One of the missions, known as a Sentinel-5p, provides timely data on a multitude of trace gases(CO, NO2, S02, O3, aerosols, etc.)</div>
<br>The exercise is divided in the following sections:
<li>1.Load Python modules
<li>2.Explore Sentinel-5p using xarray
<li> Access Groups
<li> Access variable
<li> Plot variable
<li> Geographical subset
