Analysis was carried out on Sentinel-5p. Sentinel-5p data does not only provide data for the relevant domain when downloaded. 
It also includes the data of the areas it continues to scan after the relevant area. Therefore, Sentinel-5p data have a big size.

I tried to subset the image via SNAP, but after subsetting the file format is broken. I couldn't upload it to GitHub either because of the size of the data. 
That's why I upload my data to google drive and present it to you.

There are 2 data to download. The relevant data link to be downloaded is provided separately in the 2019 and 2020 folders.

Respects.
